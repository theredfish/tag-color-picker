# tag-color-picker

Another tag plugin for my own learning. The difference with others plugins is the color picker on each tag.

## Work in progress

This plugin is work in progress, I need to improve it by :
- Creating package with Bower (dependencies, easy to install, ...),
- Refactoring the code,
- Adding some features,
- Learning more and more ... 

## How to test
Just download sources, and open in your favorite browser the `example.html` file. This plugin requires currently Jquery v2.1.4 and Bootstrap v3.3.5 (these are available in sources).

You can use your own HTML file, you just need to use same identifiers from `example.html`.

## How to use
Add your tags and separate them by `,` or by pressing `enter` key.
